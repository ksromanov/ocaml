(** TMC (Tail Modulo Cons) is a code transformation that
    rewrites transformed functions in destination-passing-style, in
    such a way that certain calls that were not in tail position in the
    original program become tail-calls in the transformed program.

    As a classic example, the following program
    {|
     let[@tail_mod_cons] rec map f = function
     | [] -> []
     | x :: xs ->
       let y = f x in
       y :: map f xs
    |}
    becomes (expressed in almost-source-form; the translation is in
    fact at the Lambda-level)
    {|
     let rec map f = function
     | [] -> []
     | x :: xs _>
       let y = f x in
       let dst = y :: Placeholder in
       map_dps dst 1 f xs; dst
     and map_dps dst offset f = function
     | [] ->
       dst.offset <- []
     | x :: xs ->
       let y = f x in
       let dst' = y :: Placeholder in
       dst.offset <- dst';
       map_dps dst 1 f fx
    |}

    In this example, the expression (y :: map f xs) had a call in
    non-tail-position, and it gets rewritten into tail-calls. TMC
    handles all such cases where the continuation of the call
    (what needs to be done after the return) is a "construction", the
    creation of a (possibly nested) data block.

    The code transformation generates two versions of the
    input function, the "direct" version with the same type and
    behavior as the original one (here just [map]), and
    the "destination-passing-style" version (here [map_dps]).

    Any call to the original function from outside the let..rec
    declaration gets transformed into a call into the direct version,
    which will itself call the destination-passing-style versions on
    recursive calls that may benefit from it (they are in tail-position
    modulo constructors).

    Because of this inherent code duplication, the transformation may
    not always improve performance. In this implementation, TMC is
    opt-in, we only transform functions that the user has annotated
    with an attribute to request the transformation.

type 'offset destination = {
  var: Ident.t;
  offset: 'offset;
  loc : Debuginfo.Scoped_location.t;
}
and offset = lambda
(** In the OCaml value model, interior pointers are not allowed.  To
    represent the "placeholder to mutate" in DPS code, we thus use a pair
    of the block containing the placeholder, and the offset of the
    placeholder within the block.

    In the common case, this offset is an arbitrary lambda expression, typically
    a constant integer or a variable. We define ['a destination] as parametrized
    over the offset type to represent formal destination parameters (where
    the offset is an Ident.t), and maybe in the future statically-known
    offsets (where the offset is an integer).
*)

let add_dst_params ({var; offset} : Ident.t destination) params =
  (var, Pgenval) :: (offset, Pintval) :: params

let add_dst_args ({var; offset} : offset destination) args =
  Lvar var :: offset :: args

let assign_to_dst {var; offset; loc} lam =
  Lprim(Psetfield_computed(Pointer, Heap_initialization),
        [Lvar var; offset; lam], loc)

(** The type ['a Dps.t] (destination-passing-style) represents a
    version of ['a] that is parametrized over a [lambda destination]. *)
module Dps = struct
  type 'a t =
    tail:bool -> dst:lambda destination -> 'a
  (** A term parameterized over a destination.  The [tail] argument
      is passed by the caller to indicate whether the term will be placed
      in tail-position -- this allows to generate correct @tailcall
      annotations. *)

  (** Create a new destination-passing-style term which is simply
      setting the destination with the given [v], hence "returning"
      it. *)
  let return (v : lambda): lambda t = fun ~tail:_ ~dst ->
    assign_to_dst dst v

  let map (f : 'a -> 'b) (dps : 'a t) : 'b t = fun ~tail ~dst ->
    f @@ dps ~tail ~dst

  let pair (fa : 'a t) (fb : 'b t) : ('a * 'b) t = fun ~tail ~dst ->
    (fa ~tail ~dst, fb ~tail ~dst)

  let unit : unit t = fun ~tail:_ ~dst:_ ->
    ()
end

(** The TMC transformation requires information flows in two opposite
    directions: the information of which callsites can be rewritten in
    destination-passing-style flows from the leaves of the code to the
    root, and the information on whether we remain in tail-position
    flows from the root to the leaves -- and also the knowledge of
    which version of the function we currently want to generate, the
    direct version or a destination-passing-style version.

    To clarify this double flow of information, we split the TMC
    transform in two steps:

    1. A function [choice t] that takes a term and processes it from
    leaves to root; it produces a "code choice", a piece of data of
    type [Choice.t], that contains information on how to transform the
    input term [t] *parameterized* over the (still missing) contextual
    information.

    2. Code-production operators that have contextual information
    to transform a "code choice" into the final code.

    The code-production choices for a single term have type [lambda Choice.t];
    using a parametrized type ['a Choice.t] is useful to represent
    simultaneous choices over several subterms; for example
    [(lambda * lambda) Choice.t] makes a choice for a pair of terms,
    for example the [then] and [else] cases of a conditional. With
    this parameter, ['a Choice.t] has an applicative structure, which
    is useful to write the actual code transformation in the {!choice}
    function.
*)
module Choice = struct
  type 'a t = {
    dps : 'a Dps.t;
    direct : unit -> 'a;
    has_tmc_calls : bool;
  }
  (**
     An ['a Choice.t] represents code that may be written
     in destination-passing style if its usage context allows it.
     More precisely:

     - If the surrounding context is already in destination-passing
       style, it has a destination available, we should produce the
       code in [dps] -- a function parametrized over the destination.

     - If the surrounding context is in direct style (no destination
       is available), we should produce the fallback code from
       [direct].

       (Note: [direct] is also a function (on [unit]) to ensure that any
       effects performed during code production will only happen once we
       do know that we want to produce the direct-style code.)

     - [has_tmc_calls] is true when there are TMC opportunities
       in the subterm -- if some calls are in tail-modulo-cons
       position and are rewritten into tailcalls in the [dps] version.
